# PBAtlas Perinatal Multiome
# Highlights
1. Perinatal pig brain transcriptomic and proteomic data fills the corresponding gaps in gyrencephalic species.
2. Major transition at E94-E104 in perinatal brain development.
3. Inter-regional heterogeneity demonstrates a “rise-and-fall” pattern.
4. Brain diseases risk genes show synchronized expression in perinatal period analogous to later life.
   
# Summary
The perinatal period witnesses dynamic structural reorganization and functional specialization essential for establishing later-life neural circuitry integrity. However, molecular mechanisms governing spatiotemporal developmental trajectories during this critical window remain poorly characterized due to limited accessibility of human perinatal specimens. Here, we analyzed transcriptomes and proteomes from 336 samples across multiple time points and brain regions in perinatal Bama pigs, showing their spatiotemporal organization and concordance between genes and proteins. We characterized pigs as optimal large-animal model, demonstrating its closer analogy to humans, resemblance to monkeys, and superiority over the mice and other species, while identifying their perinatal stage as a transitional hub bridging early prenatal to postnatal molecular trajectories in humans. We revealed a pan-regional developmental inflection point (E94-E104) during the perinatal period, manifesting as order-of-magnitude changes in the expression of genes and proteins associated with synaptogenesis and gliogenesis. While further analyzing developmental velocities across pig brain regions, we discovered regional heterogeneity exhibits a remarkably synchronized rise-and-fall pattern during the perinatal period. Additionally, brain disorder risk genes exhibited convergent perinatal expression in pigs that recapitulated human later-life profiles, establishing this multi-omics atlas as a translational framework for decoding neurodevelopmental disorder pathogenesis.
